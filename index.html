     For our sketches, there would be a load up screen with the app's logo. Then, it would ask you for your preferences on what to avoid, like stairs or stoplights. Then, it would ask you to pick a destination with a search bar to find them. An informational would pop up with common obstructions, traffic patterns, etc. Then, you would be directed to the map, which has your destination, ETA, obstacles, and directions in a lower menu. There would also be an options screen that can be accessed by hitting a button after swiping up this lower menu. In this options menu, you can access and change your preferences and saved destinations.
